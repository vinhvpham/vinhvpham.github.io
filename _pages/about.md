Hello, My name is Vinh. The purpose of this page is to present my professional and hobby work in coding and sofware and to network with other developers.

Fairly young in my career but interested in the fields of web development, game development, and QA testing, although I am pretty flexible.

Hobbies include gaming, badminton, poker, and restoring old PCs.
